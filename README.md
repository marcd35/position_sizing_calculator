## What This Tool Does

This calculator helps you answer one critical question: **"How many shares should I buy?"**

It provides three different calculation methods so you can choose the approach that matches your trading strategy:

1. **Total Risk %** - Risk a percentage of your account (e.g., "I risk 1% per trade")
2. **Dollar Risk** - Risk a fixed dollar amount (e.g., "I risk $100 per trade")
3. **Position %** - Allocate a percentage of capital (e.g., "I put 5% of my account in each trade")

All three methods help you size positions properly based on your entry price and stop loss.

**Using Total Risk % Calculator:**
- Account Value: $10,000
- Risk %: 1%
